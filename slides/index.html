                    <p> Welcome to the computer mapping session!!! In the next
                    few minutes, you will go on a whirlwind tour that will
                    allow you to <b>discover</b> the city of <b>Liverpool</b> using <b>spatial
                        data</b>. <br>In the process, you will get to play with some
                    of the most exciting technology to make maps.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p> Move through the notes by navigating the arrows. </p>

<ul>
<li class='fragment current-visible'>Spatial data are displayed in ‘layers’ – each layer displays a different variable for Liverpool</li>
<li class='fragment current-visible'>At the minute, population density is the only visible layer on the map</li>
<li class='fragment current-visible'><b>Population density</b> takes the number of people who live in each area and
    divides it by the size of the area (km2 in our case)</li>
<li class='fragment current-visible'>The map is coloured based on these values, with lighter values representing greater density</li>
<li class='fragment current-visible'> Which areas of Liverpool have the
    highest population density? Why might this be? </li>

                    <p class='fragment current-visible'> Welcome to the
                    <b>"Output Area Classification"</b> (OAC), a product of our very
                    own Professor Alex Singleton. The OAC is a <i>neighborhood
                        classification</i>.</p>
                    <p class='fragment current-visible'> Neighbourhood
                    classifications are data-driven descriptions of places.
                    Using large amounts of quantitative information, we are
                    able to draw this empirical portraits of the character of
                    an area.</p>

                    <h1> OAC groups (pt. I) </h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Hard pressed living</b>: Typically found in urban areas, residents are less diverse (mostly White). Occupations are dominated by manual labour opportunities. </li>
<li><b>Constrained city dwellers</b>: Neighbourhoods are characterised by social housing and residents tend to be older on average (with a lower proportion of children in the area). Unemployment rates are higher than other groups, with educational levels lower.</li>
<li><b>Urbanites</b>: Residents tend to be employed in financial, public administration and education-related roles. Main urban areas, with a mix of terraces and flats.</li>
<li><b>Suburbanites</b>: Areas located on the outskirts of urban areas. Characterised by semi-detached houses. Residents are a mixture of young families and retired individuals, and are above average in terms of incomes.</li>
</ul>
				</section>
                <section>
                    <h1> OAC groups (pt. II) </h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Cosmopolitans</b>: Densely populated, these areas are dominated by privately rented flats and younger populations (particularly students and young professionals)</li>
<li><b>Multicultural metropolitans</b>: Terraced housing dominates these areas. There is a high ethnic mix, and most other characteristics are at national average (less distinct then!)</li>
<li><b>Ethnicity central</b>: Higher concentrations of non-White populations. Typically younger, renting accommodation and higher unemployment. </li>
<li><b>Rural residents</b>: Rural areas with an older and affluent population (there are none of these in Liverpool – a truly urban city!)</li>
</ul>

            OAC goes beyond Liverpool to include the entire country. Click on

                link</a> and enter your own postcode - does the description of
            the neighborhood describe your perception of the place well?

            <p> Let's peel off the OAC layer. Click on the
            'tick' of the population density layer and it'll disappear from
            the map, uncovering a map of every building in Liverpool.<p>
            <p> 
            Try and find:
            <ul>
                <li class='fragment'> <b>Anfield</b> (clue: Look North towards
                    Stanley park) </li>
                <li class='fragment'> <b>Albert Docks</b> (clue: Follow the River
                    Mersey until you get to the city centre)</li>
                <li class='fragment'> <b>Liverpool John Lennon airport</b> (clue: Try
                South Liverpool)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p> You may have noticed on the right hand side some sliders.
            These show graphs that allow you to further explore the population
            of Liverpool. Use them to filter the data presented on the
            map based on these values. Try clicking on ‘percentage of
            students’ and dragging the bars to select only the highest
            percentage values. This will update the map (it will take a moment
            while it works its magic) to show only those areas with the
            highest percentages of students.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p> Try to find an answer for the following questions: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class='fragment current-visible'>  which area contains the
                highest number of students in Liverpool? </li>
            <li class='fragment current-visible'>  Where are the two main
                areas which students live in Liverpool? Why might students be
            attracted to these areas? </li>
            <li class='fragment current-visible'> How does the spatial
                distribution of students relate to patterns in population
                density?  </li>
            <li class='fragment current-visible'> You may have noticed that
                all buildings are coloured in including Anfield – but no
                students live in the stadium (and some keen fans have tried),
            why might this be? (clue: think back to the population density map
            – where might the building values come from?)</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

    <section>
        <h1> Questions </h1>
        <p>Combine the OAC layer with the population sliders to
        answer the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class='fragment'> Which type of neighborhoods do students live in?</li>
            <li class='fragment'> How are these areas different from the rest of
                Liverpool </li>

        <p> <b>Well done</b> on completing the short practical! We hope that we have
        given you a little flavour of what we do here in Liverpool, although
        this is only the basics – we will show you not only how to make maps
        like this, but how to analyse and understand them.</p>
        <p>Please do use any remaining time to ask us any question you may have
        about our degree or the city itself!</p>
